            <p class="p_body">I am an intelligent, reliable and enthusiastic worker looking to build work experience as I continue my studies within Software and Electronic Systems Engineering.  During my A-Level Software Systems Development coursework, I engaged in a full suite of application testing and report writing to support the successful app development. As a volunteer dinghy instructor, I have experience of engaging with people from various walks of life and holding a level of responsibility.  During my seven years at Grosvenor Grammar School I have achieved a near 100% attendance record for both attendance and punctuality.  I currently am studying Software and Electronic Systems Engineering at Queens University Belfast.</p>
